                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Quantum computing is an exciting and rapidly evolving field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in ways that classical computers cannot. This blog will introduce you to the basics of quantum computing, its key concepts, and its potential applications.

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Quantum computing is a type of computation that harnesses the unique behavior of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform calculations. Unlike classical computers, which use bits (0s and 1s) as the smallest unit of data, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits.

                        <h2 class="subtitle">1. Qubits:</h2>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            In classical computing, a bit can be either 0 or 1. A qubit,
                            however, can be in a state of 0, 1, or any quantum superposition of these states. This allows quantum computers to process a vast amount of information simultaneously. <br>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Superposition refers to a qubit's ability to be in multiple states at once. This property is what gives quantum computers their parallel processing power. <br><br>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            
                            Entanglement is a quantum phenomenon where qubits become interconnected such that the state of one qubit directly influences the state of another, no matter how far apart they are. This can be used to perform complex computations more efficiently. <br><br>

                            Quantum gates are the building blocks of quantum circuits. They manipulate qubits through quantum operations. Some common quantum gates include the Hadamard gate, Pauli-X gate, and CNOT gate.
