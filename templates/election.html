                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Elections are a cornerstone of modern democratic societies.

                    <h2 class="title">⭕ History of Elections</h2>

                        The concept of elections dates back to ancient Greece and Rome, where citizens would vote to elect officials. However, the modern system of democratic elections, as we know it today, evolved significantly over the centuries. Key milestones include the Magna Carta in 1215, which laid the groundwork for parliamentary democracy in England, and the subsequent spread of democratic principles during the Enlightenment and the Age of Revolution.
